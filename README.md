As a possibly insane Tampa Bay Bucs fan (and quickly recovering Tom Brady hater), this NFL offseason has been the craziest one I can remember. Since my girlfriend would attest that I think way too much about the Bucs already, I figured I would lay my thoughts out on a website that can grow and change as I get better at coding and as the Bucs do even wilder things.
